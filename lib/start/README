These three .o files, crt1.o, crti.o, and crtn.o are used in initialization. In
particular, crt1.o contains the _start symbol where the program begins. After
doing some basic initialization like going through all the initializers for
different modules, it calls some other stuff and eventually calls to main().

We modified sysdeps/i386/start.S in glibc which contains the definition of
_start. Our version of the file can be found in this directory, along with the
object files. It calls baggy_init which sets up all the memory, including the
stack and allocator. We want to do this as early as possible so we have the most
control.
